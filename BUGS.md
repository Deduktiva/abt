KNOWN BUGS
----------

Issuer Company page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* "Contact Line 1" and "Contact Line 2" fold whitespace on the show page, but this whitespace is significant.

Customers
~~~~~~~~~

* Customers which have been used are allowed to be deleted by the UI, however they should not be.
* Customers which have ever been used cannot be marked inactive, so the list when creating a new invoice is always very long.

Old pages
~~~~~~~~~

* The "Customer", "Project", "Product" show pages do not match their nice edit equivalents.
